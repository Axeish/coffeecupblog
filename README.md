# Coffee Cup Blog

A fun Ruby on Rails project to set up a techincal blog where each post can be read entirely in 15 minutes with your coffee cup. I take a 15 minutes coffee break and I look for posts, blogs, website that I can cover in 10-15 minutes while I can also finish my coffee. Nope, they dont exist because all post usually want to include as much as possible. 

*Inspired by Linked List

* The posts would be mostly for people in creative field trying to learn programming language. ( including portfolio building from scratch without  paying a lot of $$$). This will keep in mind for beginner and expert. ( Hide and Display some context which is not obvious for computer geeks )

* Include links if its a part of big series. Focus would be to have a finished subproject. Challnege is to finish something working within 15 minutes of work.
